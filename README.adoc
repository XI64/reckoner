# Rekoner 

This is a test-demo-dummy project for me to learn. Massively WIP.

* Root Name = reckoner

---

## Design Choices:
 * 1. Usage of String attributes instead of integer attributes : Readability
 * 2. Hypothetical Instruction Set : This is just a demo project
 * 3. String defined cells : Readability
 
  All in all this is just a demo (beginner) project so the choices are very noobish as well as
  rudimentary.
